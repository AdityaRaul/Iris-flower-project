# Dataset
The Iris dataset, introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936, is a widely used dataset in machine learning. It consists of 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica). Each sample is described by 4 features:

Sepal length (cm)
Sepal width (cm)
Petal length (cm)
Petal width (cm)
# Model
Model
The model is a [insert type of model, e.g. neural network, decision tree, etc.]. It is trained on the Iris dataset to predict the species of an Iris flower based on its physical characteristics.
# Problem Statement
 Classify Iris flowers into their respective species (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica) based on their physical characteristics, such as sepal and petal length and width.
# Project Summary: 
This project develops a machine learning classification model that accurately predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its physical characteristics, using the classic Iris dataset, and provides a user-friendly interface for inputting flower characteristics to obtain species predictions.
# Key Project Details:
Dataset: Classic Iris dataset (150 samples, 4 features, 3 classes)

Features: Sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width

Target Variable: Species of Iris flower (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, Iris virginica)

Machine Learning Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree

Model Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy

Tools and Technologies: Python, scikit-learn

User Interface: Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with Tkinter

## Conclusion:

The project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a machine learning model for Iris flower classification. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and model deployment using Streamlit. The deployed model allows users to input sepal and petal measurements and receive predictions of the Iris flower species. The results show that Logistic Regression outperforms the other models, achieving the highest accuracy, precision, and recall.
