# Iris-flower-project
A machine learning classification model that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its physical characteristics, trained on the classic Iris dataset.
# Dataset
The Iris dataset, introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936, is a widely used dataset in machine learning. It consists of 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica). Each sample is described by 4 features:

Sepal length (cm)
Sepal width (cm)
Petal length (cm)
Petal width (cm)
# Model
Model
The model is a [insert type of model, e.g. neural network, decision tree, etc.]. It is trained on the Iris dataset to predict the species of an Iris flower based on its physical characteristics.
